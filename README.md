# Bytecrackers Project - Classified Document Integrity & Clearance Verification Platform

A secure web-based platform for verifying document integrity using cryptographic hashing and managing multi-level clearance-based access control with blockchain-style immutable audit logging.

**One-Line Summary:**  
*"We upgraded the system to store documents off-chain while maintaining on-chain cryptographic hashes, clearance verification, and immutable audit records, transforming it into a Classified Document Integrity & Clearance Verification Platform."*

---

## 📋 Overview

This platform implements an advanced document verification system that ensures the integrity of classified documents through **off-chain storage** and **on-chain cryptographic fingerprints**. It features a sophisticated clearance verification system and maintains an immutable blockchain-style audit ledger of all access attempts.

The system has been upgraded from a basic verification tool to a production-grade platform demonstrating:
- ✅ Off-chain encrypted document storage
- ✅ On-chain cryptographic fingerprints (SHA-256)
- ✅ Multi-level clearance verification system
- ✅ Blockchain-style immutable audit ledger with hash chaining
- ✅ Approval ID system for access tracking
- ✅ Privacy by design - no sensitive data on-chain

---

7. **Access the platform:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Testing the System

1. **Test Integrity Verification:**
   - Click "Verify Document Integrity"
   - Document will be registered with SHA-256 hash
   - Subsequent clicks will verify hash hasn't changed

2. **Test Clearance Levels:**
   - Try Admin (Level 3) → Should be granted

   - Try Auditor (Level 1) → Should be denied
   - Notice the Approval IDs generated

3. **View Blockchain:**
   - Click "View Immutable Audit Trail"
   - See hash chaining with previousHash → currentHash
   - Observe immutable record of all actions

4. **View Registry:**
   - Click "View Document Registry"
   - See all registered documents with metadata

## 💻 Usage Guide

### Web Interface Features

The enhanced web interface provides six main operations organized by function:

#### 🔑 Integrity Verification Section
1. **Verify Document Integrity** - Checks cryptographic hash against registry
2. **View Document Registry** - Shows all registered document fingerprints with metadata

#### 👤 Clearance Verification Section
3. **Admin Access (Level 3)** - Tests highest clearance level access
4. **Officer Access (Level 2)** - Tests standard document access
5. **Auditor Access (Level 1)** - Tests limited clearance access

#### 📊 Audit Section
6. **View Immutable Audit Trail** - Displays blockchain-style audit ledger with hash chaining

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Authentication
```
POST /auth/bootstrap
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/refresh
POST /auth/logout
POST /auth/users
```

Bootstrap is allowed only once to create the first admin.

---

### Documents
```
POST /documents/upload
GET /documents
GET /documents/:id
POST /documents/:id/verify
GET /documents/:id/download
```

Uploads are encrypted at rest. Verification recomputes SHA-256 hashes from decrypted content.

---

### Access Requests
```
POST /access/request
```

Evaluates clearance against document requirements and returns an approval ID.

---

### Audit Ledger
```
GET /audit/ledger
GET /audit/verify
```

Ledger entries are hash-chained and can be validated via the verify endpoint.

---

### Security Model

**Off-Chain Components:**
- Actual documents (encrypted)
- Secure storage infrastructure
- Sensitive content protected

**On-Chain Components:**
- Document fingerprints (SHA-256 hashes)
- Audit ledger (blockchain-style)
- Access approval records
- Clearance verification logs
- Hash chains for immutability

---

## 📝 Configuration

### User Clearance Levels

Edit `users.json` to manage users and clearance levels:

```json
{
  "username": {
    "role": "OFFICER",
    "clearanceLevel": 2
  }
}
```

**Clearance Level Guidelines:**
- **Level 3**: Full system access (Admin)
- **Level 2**: Document access (Officer, Manager)
- **Level 1**: Limited access (Auditor, Guest)

### Document Security Settings

In `access.js`, configure:
```javascript
const DOCUMENT_REQUIRED_CLEARANCE = 2;  // Minimum clearance needed
const DOCUMENT_STORAGE_PATH = "./secure_storage/";  // Off-chain storage
```

---

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

### ✅ What Makes This Platform Unique

1. **True Off-Chain Storage**: Documents never exposed to blockchain
2. **Cryptographic Fingerprints**: Only hashes stored on-chain
3. **Multi-Level Clearance**: Not just roles, but graduated clearance levels
4. **Approval System**: Unique approval IDs for audit compliance
5. **Hash-Chained Ledger**: Each block references previous block hash
6. **Privacy by Design**: Sensitive content never leaves secure storage

### 📊 Blockchain Implementation

Our audit ledger uses blockchain principles:
- **Immutability**: Append-only structure
- **Chaining**: Each block contains previous block hash
